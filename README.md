### Project Description
The primary question we are trying to answer to is how can convolutional layers be integrated into autoencoder architectures to enhance anomaly detection in spacecraft telemetry data? In efforts to answer this question, we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) within the frameworks of Autoencoders; particularly Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE). We also work with TCN Convolutional network.
